2. Score tracks based on similarity to user
   TBD by all user playlists, or track similarity that user inserts
   Return top scored tracks as recommendations
3. Build UI for user to get recommendations (React frontend)

### todo

4. provide data visualization at least for when songs are released, possibly for stats
5. scrape all/more curated playlists
6. use database to store all scraped songs
7. build cache to store songs that already have been scored
