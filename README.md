simple song recommender using spotify api

## Goals

1. Scrape spotify for tracks
   For now can scrape just https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ttf8zNG34K5SSdZRzqhVR?si=38d3e55d9f41429d
2. Score tracks based on similarity to user
   TBD by all user playlists, or track similarity that user inserts
   Return top scored tracks as recommendations
3. Build UI for user to get recommendations (React frontend)
